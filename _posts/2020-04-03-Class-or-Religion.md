title: "Why the hate?"
---

A video went viral in India last night. In this video, we all saw what happened in Indore. We all saw how the paramedical team was attacked. Most of my friends and relatives are angry and rightly so. What happened in Indore was despicable and abhorrent, and doesn’t deserve a place in society. My social media feed has been filled with posts that are blaming Muslims for this incident. However, I would like to point out that the majority of us are coming to a wrong, or maybe a partial conclusion.

I would like to clear it out first that in no way I am suggesting that Islam is a liberal religion. It is one of the most regressive religions on the planet. In my opinion, all the Abrahamic religions like Judaism, Christianity and Islam have traditionally been more regressive than their Dharmik counterparts like Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. However, Christianity and Judaism have reinvented themselves; and they are pretty liberal religions now. Islam hasn’t evolved with time and needs to reinvent itself soon.
Now that my opinion on Islam is clear, let’s move to what’s pertinent to this post.

What happened in Indore was not an isolated incident; similar incidents have been reported from slums of Mumbai, Chandigarh, Madhubani( Bihar), Patna, and many other places. While a correlation between these incidents and Islam is an obvious one to make, there is another correlation that most of us have been oblivious to. If you notice most of these incidents occurred in very poor neighbourhoods; which paints a picture of class disenfranchisement and establishment-phobia. No matter how much middle-class and upper-class people like us would like to deny it, police brutality is very prevalent in our country. The phrase “Laato ke bhoot baato se nahi maante” has become so enshrined in our society that we don’t understand that poor people are the victims of this. I see fruit vendors getting beaten daily in my town even though they are allowed to operate under essential services. Lower strata of our country have been disenfranchised for centuries; first by landlords and then by the establishment and police. It is this issue that we need to be focusing on.

There are several research papers from renowned economists establishing a clear correlation between class disenfranchisement, establishment-phobia and economic well being. This is a major reason why black neighbourhoods in the United States have higher crime rates than white neighbourhoods. This is the reason why North Bihar has a higher crime rate than South Bihar. Poverty breeds crime and fear of government, when you are poor and marginalised, your only hope becomes religion; unfortunately in Islam’s case, it pushes people centuries back and this results in even more fear-mongering and hate.

Why am I writing this? My sole goal is to make people aware that religion while being an important factor is not the primary one. The primary factor is class, and we have to fix it. Next time you see a video like Indore again, think about economic issues too.

Shivam
